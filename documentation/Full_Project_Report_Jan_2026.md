# Full Project Report: Swarm Feedback
**Date:** January 6, 2026
**Generated By:** AI Assistant (Antigravity)

## 1. Executive Summary
"Swarm Feedback" is a comprehensive, multi-role feedback platform designed to facilitate project submissions and peer reviews. The application distinguishes between three primary user roles: **Submitter**, **Reviewer**, and **Admin**, each with a tailored user interface and feature set. The project leverages a robust Spring Boot backend with MongoDB and a high-performance React frontend styled with modern glassmorphism aesthetics.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### Backend (Spring Boot 3.2.5)
The backend is built using Java 17 and Spring Boot, focusing on scalability and security.
*   **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL) for flexible data storage of users, submissions, and feedbacks.
*   **Security**: Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
*   **API Documentation**: Integrated OpenAPI (Swagger) for API visualization.
*   **Key Dependencies**:
    *   `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb`: Database interaction.
    *   `spring-boot-starter-security`: Authentication and Authorization.
    *   `jjwt-api` (0.11.5): Token generation and parsing.
    *   `lombok`: Boilerplate reduction.
    *   `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui`: API docs.

### Frontend (React 19 + Vite)
The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built for performance and visual appeal.
*   **Build Tool**: Vite (Rolldown) for instant server starts and hot updates.
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (v4 alpha) for utility-first styling.
*   **Animations**: Framer Motion and AnimeJS for fluid UI transitions.
*   **3D Elements**: React Three Fiber / Drei for immersive background elements.
*   **State/Data**: Axios for API requests, React Hooks for state management.
*   **Routing**: React Router DOM (v7).

## 4. User Interface (UI) & Design Philosophy
The project follows a **"Futuristic Glassmorphism"** design language:
*   **Visuals**: Translucent cards, vibrant gradients, and blurred backgrounds.
*   **Interactivity**: Hover effects, smooth page transitions, and micro-interactions.
*   **Responsiveness**: Fully responsive layouts using Tailwind's grid and flexbox systems.

    *   **Submitters**: See "My Projects", "Received Feedback", and "Submit Project" options.
    *   **Reviewers**: See "Explore Projects", "My Reviews", and rating interface.
    *   **Admins**: Comprehensive table views, moderation tools, and hidden personal profile elements.
